Online Clothing Store Project
Django is a popular Python-based web framework that is open-source. It was created to make building sophisticated, database-driven websites with reusable pluggable components as simple as possible. Django is well-known for being utilized on websites like Online Clothing Store. In this project, I created a Django website to let visitors to purchase things from my online clothing store. Aside from Django for the basic functionality, I improved the user experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
